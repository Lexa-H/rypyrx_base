Two classic models in spatial analysis are the *Spatial Lag Model*, defined as

$$y = \rho Wy + \beta X + \epsilon$$

and the *Spatial Error Model* defined as

<!-- use html comments for in-text notes.

You can dropdown to real latex any time you need to. If necessary,
add the library in the `header-includes` section of the quarto yaml

for example if you needed aligned equations, you can `split` with ampersands
where you want to set the alignment

$$
\begin{split}
y & = \beta X + u\\
u & = \lambda W u + \epsilon
\end{split}
