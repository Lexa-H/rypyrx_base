  abstract     = {Graduate-level textbook in spatial statistics, econometrics, and regional analysis concentrates on the relevance of spatial effects to general issues of model specification, estimation, and other inference, taking a model-driven rather than a data-driven approach. Includes new methods and findings, and many new empirical examples. Introduces the formal probabilistic framework for the analysis of spatial processes. Covers estimation and hypothesis testing, discussing situations where the data are characterized by spatial dependence, the data are characterized by spatial heterogeneity, and where a time-space model is used. Outlines methodological problems arising in estimation and hypothesis testing. Provides an extensive empirical illustration for the various estimators and tests. Examines issues of model validation, discussing two types of specification tests: tests on spatial common factors and tests on non-nested hypotheses. Discusses model selection in spatial econometric models. Suggests directions for future research. Anselin is with the Department of Geography and Economics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Index.},

  abstract   = {Understanding neighborhood context is critical for social science research, public policy analysis, and urban planning. The social meaning, formal definition, and formal operationalization of “neighborhood” depends on the study or application, however, so neighborhood analysis and modeling requires both flexibility and adherence to a formal pipeline. Maintaining that balance is challenging for a variety of reasons. To address those challenges,               geosnap               , the Geospatial Neighborhood Analysis Package provides a suite of tools for exploring, modeling, and visualizing the social context and spatial extent of neighborhoods and regions over time. It brings together state-of-the-art techniques from geodemographics, regionalization, spatial data science, and segregation analysis to support social science research, public policy analysis, and urban planning. It provides a simple interface tailored to formal analysis of spatiotemporal urban data.},

  abstract     = {PySAL is a library for geocomputation and spatial data science. Written in Python, the library has a long history of supporting novel scholarship and broadening methodological impacts far afield of academic work. Recently, many new techniques, methods of analyses, and development modes have been implemented, making the library much larger and more encompassing than that previously discussed in the literature. As such, we provide an introduction to the library as it stands now, as well as the scientific and conceptual underpinnings of its core set of components. Finally, we provide a prospective look at the library's future evolution.},
